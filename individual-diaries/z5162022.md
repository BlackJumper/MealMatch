## Week1

**_what was finished_**  
The project to be done was decided - MealMatch! We made a team of 5, created Slack accounts and Github Repo. Anshita is the Group Admin!
I looked for userful APIs we can incorporate into our project, and found MealMatch to be the most comprehensive food API, with a reasonable price. I used it with a React Application to test it, and the features it offers seem to be great for our needs.
I finished a proof of concept called 'qooking-quest' using and deployed it [here](https://qooking-quest.netlify.app/#/recipe)

**_main technical and non-technical obstacles_**  
I was not familiar with writing user stories, so we did it together as a team, with everyone contributing.

**_what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project_**  
We did not finish storyboards + architecture diagrams, because it would be difficult on Zoom. We would do that next week. Additionally, sharing drawings was difficult over the internet because it is harder to gesture and draw on the screen.

**_what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week)_**  
We will finish the flowcharts, storyboards and architecture diagrams. We will ask Ali(Tutor) if we need to do all user stories, or just the user stories for the POC for now. I will try to look up some very intuitive search interfaces which we can use for our application.
